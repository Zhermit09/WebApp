    Learned about fetch.
    Funktionen .json() funkade inte när jag fetchade, troligen för att jag försökte att omvandla något som inte var ett json.
    Nu håller på att lära mig om OAuth 2.0 för att kunna komma in på ett google konto. (1h later, "Probably going to regret this")

19/4
    OAuth 2.0
    Got my parameters from google.devolpers.console website.
    API documentation https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/javascript-implicit-flow#oauth-2.0-endpoints_1

        Cilent ID: 82346440292-hlpvrpvqk6epjgqkk93566mdd6mtqocp.apps.googleusercontent.com
        Client secret: Fyq8ymxUxmfUMxoTT7nMavoB


    After a bit off suffering and got a link that will authorize the user
         https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?
         scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.courses&
         include_granted_scopes=true&
         response_type=token&

    Today was filled with a lot of pain.
    I learnt that my token has to go in a header when i make requests
    Not a lot to talk about just hours of trial and error
    Got blocked by Cors

    Changed from Authentication to Authorization which fixed CORD block
    Succesfully retrived Json with my courses from classroom
    Succesfully extracted data from Json

23/4
    New scope:
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.coursework.me.readonly

    New reequest:
    https://classroom.googleapis.com/v1/courses/{classrom id here}/courseWork

    After more unga bunga i was able to fetch assgments data
    Next i plan to create a list with all assgments that have a due date
    then i can start adding them to callendar, but before that i prob should clean up the code mess

29/4
    Was building a function to get all classroom ids first and then get all the assigment with those ids
    Realized that it was fetching our old classrooms as well (even those we got kicked from)

30/4
    Batch sending of requests
    a bunch of request optimazations

7/5
    List
    Starting to assemble info in obejects so that i can sort and use it easier

10/5
    Changed styles of the objects

17/5
    Started working on filtering

19/5
    Finshed filtering and search functions, they are a mess codewise but seem to work.
    Added loader spinner.
    Created list with objects of assigments with all the propperties i want, now can easily add more if needed.
    Btw "React" who? "JQuery" who?
    !!!Might replace forEach() with every() to break out of it whenever done

24/5
    After days of pain i finallly figured out why my friends were recieving errors
    One of the bugs was that when you add multiple scopes u have to tie them with %20 and not &. For some
    magical fkn reason my enviorment was automaticly changning %20 but i could not see because i was clearing url hash.
    The other seem to have not uppdated something idk, because god knows what content_script.js is coming from. And after i used his account on
    my pc i saw no errors (other than errors the app worked just fine). Lastly because one has skipped some JP courses his
    empty course "Hackaton" shifted places which exposed bug in my cleaning function. Which was only splicing the first item in array,

    God im tired...
